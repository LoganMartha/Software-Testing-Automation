# Software-Testing-Automation

The purpose of this project is to develop and test a mobile application's back-end services for managing contacts, tasks, and appointments using Java. The project focuses on creating these services and their associated objects according to specific requirements, then verifying their functionality through unit tests using JUnit. The goal is to ensure the services can add, update, and delete records effectively. Additionally, the tests must provide a minimum of 80% code coverage to confirm the services work as expected.
